## Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets

In July of 2016 during the 2016 Presidential campaign, I collected a little over 270,000 tweets using the Twitter API and filtered for tweets that contained ‘Trump’, ‘DonaldTrump’, ‘Hillary’, ‘Clinton’, or ‘HillaryClinton’, and performed sentiment analysis.
