### Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets

In July of 2016 during the 2016 Presidential campaign, I collected a little over 270,000 tweets using the Twitter API and filtered for tweets that contained ‘Trump’, ‘DonaldTrump’, ‘Hillary’, ‘Clinton’, or ‘HillaryClinton’, and performed sentiment analysis.

### Documents:  
preprocessing.py contains functions for preprocessing the tweets.  
model_helper.py contains helper functions for modeling.  
2 ipython notebooks (part 1-preprocessing, part 2- modeling)
